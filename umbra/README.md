Make sure you have the docker image and the datasets available before running the queries with Umbra.

## Docker image

See the [docker](docker/README.md) folder for instructions on how to download the docker image.

## Datasets

You should have the following three folders available:

- `scripts/job/data`
- `scripts/statsceb/data`
- `scripts/ce/data`

If you don't have them, you can copy them from `../benchmarks/imdb/data`, `../benchmarks/stats-ceb/data`, and `../benchmarks/ce/data` respectively.
