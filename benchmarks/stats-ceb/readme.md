Field names in the STATS-CEB benchmark contain capital letters, which causes problems when running queries in Datafusion. Datafusion will convert all relation and field names in SQL queries to lowercase. For example: `SELECT Id FROM users` will be converted to `SELECT id FROM users`, and Datafusion will not be able to find the field `id` (since the field name is `Id`). Therefore, we translated all field names in the STATS-CEB benchmark to lowercase. This way, the queries can be run without any issues. (The data itself was not modified, only the field names in the queries were changed.)
